## The One-Paragraph Story

### For Judgment Sellers / Incubators

Dragonfly Civil is a New York-based judgment enforcement firm that acquires small- to mid-size judgments and systematically enforces them. We combine traditional legal collection methods with modern data enrichment, automated workflow tools, and disciplined compliance practices. Unlike buyers who sit on portfolios hoping for passive returns, we actively work every case through a proprietary ops console—skip tracing, asset discovery, garnishment, and negotiated settlements. If you have judgments that need an operator, not just a buyer, Dragonfly is your partner.

### For Capital Partners

Dragonfly Civil is building the modern infrastructure for judgment enforcement. We acquire portfolios of money judgments at steep discounts and enforce them through a technology-enabled operations platform. Our proprietary pipeline—import, enrichment, enforcement planning, and ops console—turns unstructured legal outcomes into structured, collectible assets. With 900 plaintiffs in portfolio and $250K deployed, we're proving unit economics case-by-case while building the data moat that will underpin a scalable enforcement intelligence business. This is not passive debt buying; it's operationally-intensive, legally-driven asset recovery with compounding data advantages.

### For Potential Employees

Dragonfly Civil is a family-run judgment enforcement company in New York. We buy court judgments and collect on them—but we do it differently. We've built our own software platform to manage cases, track debtors, plan enforcement actions, and ensure compliance. You'll work at the intersection of law, data, and operations, helping build something from the ground up. We're small, scrappy, and moving fast. If you want ownership, not bureaucracy, this is the place.

## The One-Pager

### What is Dragonfly Civil?

Dragonfly Civil is a technology-enabled judgment enforcement operator based in New York. We acquire, manage, and collect on money judgments—turning legal victories into actual recoveries.

### The Problem We Solve

Millions of dollars in court judgments go uncollected every year. Plaintiffs win in court, but collecting is hard. Judgment enforcement is fragmented, labor-intensive, and requires specialized skills most law firms don't have. The result: judgments trade at 5–15 cents on the dollar, and most never get enforced.

### How We're Different

1. **We're operators, not passive buyers.** We don't sit on portfolios. We actively enforce every case through a structured workflow.

2. **We've built our own technology.** Our ops console handles case import, debtor enrichment, enforcement planning, document generation, and compliance tracking—all in one system.

3. **We're building an enforcement intelligence layer.** Every case we work adds to our proprietary data on debtor behavior, recovery rates, and enforcement strategy effectiveness.

4. **We're family-run with institutional discipline.** Mom runs daily ops. Dad handles legal strategy. Son built the tech. We move fast but operate with bank-grade compliance.

### Where We Are Today

- **Portfolio:** 900 plaintiffs under management
- **Capital:** $250K deployed
- **Platform:** Full import → enrichment → enforcement → ops console pipeline
- **Compliance:** FDCPA/FCRA/GLBA compliant with audit trails

### Where We're Going

1. **Scale the portfolio** to 5,000+ plaintiffs within 18 months
2. **Prove unit economics** across case types and debtor profiles
3. **Build the data moat** that makes our enforcement predictions better than anyone else's
4. **Become the default enforcement partner** for judgment incubators, law firms, and capital partners

### The Vision

Dragonfly is a judgment enforcement operator today. Tomorrow, it's a data company—the Bloomberg terminal for enforcement intelligence. Every case we touch trains our models. Every recovery validates our approach. The goal isn't just to collect on judgments; it's to build the proprietary dataset that makes judgment pricing, enforcement strategy, and recovery prediction a science, not a guess.

## Brand Pillars

### 1. Operator Mindset

We don't buy and hope. We buy and work. Every case gets touched, enriched, planned, and executed. Recovery is the product of disciplined operations, not luck.

### 2. Technology-First

Our platform isn't a bolt-on—it's the core of how we operate. Import, enrichment, enforcement planning, compliance tracking, and ops console are all integrated. This lets us scale without losing control.

### 3. Compliance as Competitive Advantage

FDCPA, FCRA, GLBA—we don't treat compliance as a constraint. We treat it as a moat. When we say a case is ready to enforce, it's ready. No surprises, no regulatory risk.

### 4. Data Compounding

Every case we work adds to our enforcement intelligence. Over time, this data lets us price judgments better, predict recoveries more accurately, and allocate capital more efficiently. The more we collect, the smarter we get.

### 5. Family Values, Institutional Standards

We're a family business with startup energy. But we operate with the documentation, audit trails, and governance you'd expect from a fund. Personal accountability meets professional discipline.
