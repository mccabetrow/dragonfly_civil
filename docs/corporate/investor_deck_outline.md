## Slide 2: The Problem

### $100B+ in Judgments Go Uncollected Every Year

**Visual:** Split graphic showing "Courtroom Win" → gap → "Actual Collection"

**Key Points:**

- **Plaintiffs win, but don't get paid.** Winning a judgment is just paper—collecting requires specialized enforcement.

- **Enforcement is fragmented.** No single player owns the workflow from judgment to cash.

- **Law firms don't want to do it.** Enforcement is low-margin, high-touch, and requires operational discipline most firms lack.

- **Judgment buyers often warehouse.** Many buyers acquire judgments and wait passively, hoping debtors pay voluntarily.

**Result:** Judgments trade at 5–15 cents on the dollar because the market prices in the difficulty of collection.

---

## Slide 3: Why Judgments Are Mispriced

### An Arbitrage Hiding in Plain Sight

**Visual:** Pricing spectrum from "Face Value" (100%) → "Typical Sale Price" (5–15%) → "Expected Recovery" (30–50%)

**Key Points:**

- **Information asymmetry.** Sellers don't know which judgments are collectible. Buyers with data do.

- **Operational friction.** Collection requires legal filings, debtor tracking, and sustained follow-up. Most buyers can't do this efficiently.

- **Adverse selection.** Without robust underwriting, buyers end up with the worst cases.

- **Fragmented data.** There's no "credit bureau" for judgment enforcement. Recovery intelligence is siloed.

**Dragonfly's Bet:** The discount reflects operational difficulty, not intrinsic value. If you can enforce systematically, the spread is yours.

## Slide 4: Our Solution

### Dragonfly: The Judgment Enforcement Operating System

**Visual:** Pipeline diagram: Import → Enrich → Plan → Execute → Collect

**Key Points:**

1. **Acquire** — We purchase judgment portfolios from incubators, law firms, and direct plaintiffs.

2. **Enrich** — Every debtor is skip-traced. Employers, banks, and assets are identified.

3. **Plan** — Cases are tiered by collectability and assigned enforcement actions.

4. **Execute** — Wage garnishments, bank restraints, property liens, and settlement negotiations.

5. **Collect** — Recoveries flow through. Data compounds.

**Differentiation:** We're operators, not passive buyers. Every case gets worked through a structured, technology-enabled pipeline.

## Slide 5: The Tech & Data Moat

### Proprietary Infrastructure for Judgment Enforcement

**Visual:** Screenshot or mockup of the Ops Console

**Key Points:**

| Component               | Description                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import Pipeline**     | Ingest portfolios from any vendor; normalize to canonical schema      |
| **Enrichment Engine**   | Multi-provider skip tracing, asset discovery, employer verification   |
| **Enforcement Planner** | Tier-based action sequencing with compliance gating                   |
| **Ops Console**         | Real-time case management, signature queue, call queue, activity feed |
| **Compliance Layer**    | FDCPA/FCRA/GLBA controls with full audit trails                       |

**The Data Moat:**

- Every case we work trains our recovery prediction models.
- Over time: better pricing → better case selection → higher returns.

## Slide 6: The 900-Plaintiff Portfolio

### Proof of Concept in Motion

**Visual:** Dashboard snapshot showing portfolio stats

**Key Points:**

| Metric                          | Value                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Plaintiffs Under Management** | 900                     |
| **Capital Deployed**            | $250,000                |
| **Avg. Judgment Face Value**    | $X,XXX                  |
| **Avg. Purchase Price**         | X¢ on the dollar        |
| **Pipeline Coverage**           | 100% enriched & planned |

**Status:**

- ✅ All 900 cases imported and normalized
- ✅ Enrichment complete (skip trace, employer, bank)
- ✅ Enforcement plans assigned by tier
- ⏳ Garnishment and restraint filings in progress

**First Recoveries:** Expected Q1 2026

## Slide 7: Results Roadmap

### From Proof of Concept to Scale

**Visual:** Timeline with milestones

| Milestone                    | Target                  | Timing  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| First recovery on 900 cohort | Validate unit economics | Q1 2026 |
| 2,500 plaintiffs             | Operational scale       | Q2 2026 |
| 5,000 plaintiffs             | Data moat inflection    | Q4 2026 |
| 10,000 plaintiffs            | Institutional readiness | 2027    |

**Key KPIs We're Tracking:**

- **Gross Recovery Rate** — $ collected / judgment face value
- **Net Recovery Rate** — $ collected / purchase price + enforcement cost
- **Time to First Collection** — Days from plan to first payment
- **Collection Efficiency** — $ collected per ops hour

## Slide 8: Unit Economics (Illustrative)

### How the Numbers Work

**Visual:** Waterfall or funnel chart

| Line Item               | Amount  | Notes                           |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Judgment Face Value** | $10,000 | Example case                    |
| **Purchase Price**      | $1,000  | 10¢ on the dollar               |
| **Enforcement Costs**   | $300    | Filing fees, service, legal     |
| **Total Invested**      | $1,300  |                                 |
| **Expected Recovery**   | $4,000  | 40% gross recovery rate         |
| **Net Profit**          | $2,700  | 208% return on invested capital |

**Note:** Actual returns vary by case profile. These are illustrative targets based on market benchmarks.

**Key Drivers:**

- Purchase price discipline (don't overpay)
- Recovery rate (enrich well, enforce consistently)
- Cost control (tech-enabled ops)

## Slide 9: Risk Management & Compliance

### Institutional Controls for a Family Business

**Visual:** Risk/compliance matrix

**Regulatory Compliance:**

| Regulation | How We Comply                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FDCPA**  | Time-of-day restrictions, validation notices, cease-and-desist handling |
| **FCRA**   | Permissible purpose, dispute handling, accuracy obligations             |
| **GLBA**   | Data security, access controls, vendor management                       |

**Operational Controls:**

- Full audit trails on every debtor contact and enforcement action
- Compliance gating—no action proceeds without validation
- Documented policies in `compliance_manual_v1.md`

**Portfolio Risk:**

- Diversified by debtor type, judgment size, and geography
- Tiered enforcement (no all-in bets on single cases)
- Conservative underwriting (pass on marginal cases)

## Slide 11: Capital Need & Use of Funds

### Scaling from $250K to $1M+

**Current State:**

- $250K deployed across 900 plaintiffs
- Proving unit economics case-by-case

**Capital Raise:**

- **Target:** $500K–$1M in new capital
- **Structure:** Flexible (equity, revenue share, or structured debt)

**Use of Funds:**

| Category                 | Allocation | Notes                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| **Judgment Acquisition** | 70%        | Portfolio expansion         |
| **Enforcement Costs**    | 20%        | Legal, filing, service      |
| **Technology & Ops**     | 10%        | Platform enhancements, team |

**Returns Target:**

- 25–40% annual net returns on deployed capital
- Capital returned via ongoing collections (self-liquidating)

---

## Slide 12: The Vision

### From Operator to Data Company

**Visual:** Evolution graphic: Operator → Platform → Intelligence

**Today:**

> Dragonfly is a judgment enforcement operator. We buy and collect on judgments using technology-enabled operations.

**Tomorrow:**

> Dragonfly is an enforcement intelligence company. Our data predicts which judgments are worth buying, how to enforce them optimally, and what they'll recover—before capital is deployed.

**The Long Game:**

1. **Build the portfolio.** 900 → 5,000 → 50,000 plaintiffs.
2. **Compound the data.** Every case trains our models.
3. **Productize the intelligence.** Pricing tools, enforcement-as-a-service, SaaS for law firms.
4. **Become the default.** The Bloomberg terminal for judgment enforcement.

**Why This Matters:**

> There's no enforcement data infrastructure today. The firm that builds it will set the prices, win the deals, and own the market.

# Appendix: Supporting Slides (Optional)

## A1: Judgment Enforcement 101

**What is a judgment?**

- A court order requiring one party to pay another
- Created when plaintiff wins a lawsuit (or defendant defaults)

**Why don't judgments get paid?**

- Debtors may lack assets, hide income, or simply refuse
- Enforcement requires legal action: garnishments, liens, restraints

**Who buys judgments?**

- Debt buyers, law firms, incubators, and operators like Dragonfly
- Prices range from 2¢ to 25¢ on the dollar depending on quality

## A2: Competitive Landscape

| Competitor Type         | Strengths          | Weaknesses                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Passive Debt Buyers** | Capital, volume    | No ops capability; wait-and-see         |
| **Collection Agencies** | Ops infrastructure | Lack legal tools; FDCPA limitations     |
| **Law Firms**           | Legal expertise    | Low volume; high cost; not tech-enabled |
| **Judgment Incubators** | Origination        | Need buyers/operators downstream        |
