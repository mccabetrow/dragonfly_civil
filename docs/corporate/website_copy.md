## Page 3: For Capital Partners (`/capital-partners`)

### Hero Section

**Headline:**

> Judgment enforcement. Institutionally operated.

**Subhead:**

> Dragonfly is a technology-enabled judgment enforcement firm building proprietary collection intelligence across thousands of cases. We're looking for capital partners who want exposure to legal asset recovery with operational discipline.

**CTA:** "Request Investor Materials" → mailto or contact form

---

### The Opportunity

Millions of dollars in court judgments go uncollected every year. Plaintiffs win, but collecting is hard. Judgments trade at 5–15 cents on the dollar because enforcement is fragmented, labor-intensive, and requires specialized skills.

Dragonfly solves this by combining:

- **Disciplined acquisition** of underpriced judgments
- **Technology-enabled operations** that systematize enforcement
- **Data compounding** that improves pricing and recovery predictions over time

This is not passive debt buying. It's operationally-intensive, legally-driven asset recovery with a data moat.

## Page 4: How We Operate (`/how-we-operate`)

### Hero Section

**Headline:**

> Data. Compliance. Technology.

**Subhead:**

> Dragonfly isn't just a judgment buyer—we're an enforcement operating system. Here's how we turn judgments into recoveries.

---

### Section 1: The Pipeline

```
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│    Import    │ →  │   Enrich     │ →  │    Plan      │ →  │   Execute    │
│  (Ingest)    │    │ (Skip Trace) │    │  (Tier)      │    │  (Collect)   │
└──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘
```

**Import:** Portfolios enter through our normalized import pipeline. We accept data from judgment incubators, law firms, and direct plaintiffs in any format.

**Enrich:** Every case is enriched with debtor intelligence—current address, employer, bank accounts, asset visibility. We use multiple data providers and cross-validate results.

**Plan:** Cases are tiered by collectability and assigned enforcement actions: wage garnishment, bank restraint, property lien, or settlement negotiation.

**Execute:** Our ops team works the plan. Garnishments are filed. Restraints are issued. Settlements are negotiated. Every action is logged with timestamps and audit trails.

---

### Section 2: The Technology

**Ops Console:**
Our proprietary dashboard gives operators real-time visibility into every case:

- Enforcement pipeline status
- Pending signatures and actions
- Call queue for debtor outreach
- Activity feed with case history

**Automation:**

- Automated document generation (demand letters, garnishment papers)
- Scheduled reminders and follow-ups
- Compliance gating (no action proceeds without validation)

**Data Layer:**

- Supabase/Postgres database
- Structured views for pipeline, enforcement, and activity
- Full audit history on every record

---

### Section 3: Compliance

| Regulation | How We Comply                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FDCPA**  | Time-of-day restrictions, validation notices, cease-and-desist handling, mini-Miranda disclosures |
| **FCRA**   | Permissible purpose documentation, dispute handling, accuracy obligations                         |
| **GLBA**   | Data security policies, access controls, vendor management                                        |

**Audit Trails:**
Every debtor contact, enforcement action, and data access is logged with timestamps, user IDs, and action details.

**Training:**
Operators complete FDCPA/FCRA compliance training before handling any debtor communication.

---

### Section 4: Data Compounding

Every case we work adds to our enforcement intelligence:

- **Recovery rates** by debtor profile, judgment size, and enforcement method
- **Time-to-collection** benchmarks across case types
- **Skip tracing accuracy** by data provider
- **Settlement acceptance rates** at different offer levels

Over time, this data lets us:

1. Price judgments more accurately
2. Predict recoveries before we buy
3. Allocate enforcement resources efficiently

The more we collect, the smarter we get.

> Want to see the platform in action?

**Body:**

> We're happy to walk through our ops console and enforcement process.

## Page 5: About (`/about`)

### Hero Section

**Headline:**

> Family-run. Institutionally disciplined.

**Subhead:**

> Dragonfly Civil is a New York judgment enforcement firm built by a family with law, operations, and engineering under one roof.

### Our Story

Dragonfly started with a simple observation: most judgments never get collected.

Plaintiffs win in court, but the hard work of enforcement—finding the debtor, locating assets, filing garnishments, negotiating settlements—is fragmented and inconsistent. Law firms don't want to do it. Collection agencies lack the legal tools. And judgment buyers often just sit on portfolios, hoping someone pays.

We decided to be different.

We built Dragonfly to be an operator, not a buyer. We acquire judgments and actively enforce them—every case, every time. And we built our own technology to do it at scale without losing control.

Today, we're a small team with 900 plaintiffs under management. Tomorrow, we'll be the default enforcement partner for incubators, law firms, and capital partners who want judgments worked, not warehoused.

---

### The Team

| Role                       | Description                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dad (Legal & Strategy)** | Oversees legal strategy, judgment acquisition, and capital partner relationships. 25+ years in law and finance.   |
| **Mom (Operations)**       | Runs daily enforcement operations. Manages the ops console, debtor outreach, and case execution.                  |
| **Son (Technology)**       | Built the Dragonfly platform. Handles import pipeline, enrichment engine, ops console, and compliance automation. |

### Our Values

| Value                     | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work the Case**         | We don't buy and hope. Every judgment gets a plan, and every plan gets executed.            |
| **Compliance First**      | We treat regulation as a moat, not a constraint. If it's not compliant, it doesn't ship.    |
| **Data Compounds**        | Every case we work makes us smarter. We're building intelligence, not just collecting debt. |
| **Family Accountability** | We're a family. Our name is on the door. We do right because it's who we are.               |
