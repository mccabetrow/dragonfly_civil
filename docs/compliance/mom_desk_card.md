## ✅ The 10 DOs

| #   | DO THIS                                                                                                                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Identify yourself clearly** – "This is [Name] from Dragonfly Civil calling about a court judgment."                                       |
| 2   | **Deliver Mini-Miranda on first contact** – "This is an attempt to collect a debt. Any information obtained will be used for that purpose." |
| 3   | **Check the system before calling** – Confirm call is permitted, no flags, no disputes.                                                     |
| 4   | **Log every call immediately** – Date, time, outcome, notes. If it's not logged, it didn't happen.                                          |
| 5   | **Listen carefully** – If they say "dispute," "stop calling," "bankruptcy," or "lawyer," pay attention and act.                             |
| 6   | **Stay calm and professional** – No matter how rude or hostile they are. Take a breath if needed.                                           |
| 7   | **Offer payment options** – We want money, not conflict. Be solution-oriented.                                                              |
| 8   | **Escalate when unsure** – Ask a supervisor rather than guess. There's no penalty for asking.                                               |
| 9   | **Respect time restrictions** – 8 AM to 9 PM in THEIR time zone only.                                                                       |
| 10  | **Protect their information** – Don't discuss with others, don't leave screens visible, don't share passwords.                              |

## ❌ The 10 DON'Ts

| #   | NEVER DO THIS                                                                           |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Never threaten jail, arrest, or violence** – Debt is civil, not criminal. Ever.       |
| 2   | **Never lie about who you are** – No pretending to be courts, sheriffs, or lawyers.     |
| 3   | **Never discuss the debt with anyone else** – Not family, not employers, not neighbors. |
| 4   | **Never call outside 8 AM–9 PM their time** – Even if you're working late.              |
| 5   | **Never continue after they say "stop calling"** – Log it, flag it, move on.            |
| 6   | **Never collect during an active dispute** – Wait for verification to be sent.          |
| 7   | **Never make up numbers** – Quote only what's in the system.                            |
| 8   | **Never curse, insult, or lose your temper** – Hang up before you blow up.              |
| 9   | **Never override system warnings** – If the system says no, the answer is no.           |
| 10  | **Never promise what you can't deliver** – "Let me check on that" is always okay.       |
